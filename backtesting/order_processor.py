    OrderProcessor handles the execution of buy and sell orders for a portfolio using market data and a fee structure.

    Methods:
        - process_order(coin, amount, action_type, execution_timestamp, portfolio): Processes a buy or sell order at a given timestamp.
        - _process_buy_order(...): Internal method to process a buy order.
        - _process_sell_order(...): Internal method to process a sell order.

    Example usage:
        processor = OrderProcessor(fees_graph, dataloader)
